*** in .env file I was using : instead of = 
        like PORT:3000 instead of PORT=3000
*** in package.json forgot to set "type": "module"
*** script for nodemon start.
*** mongoose.connect is a promising fucntion so we use .then and .catch to catch error.
*** I was using .catch inside .then which is wrong
===> Models will contain the models of the user and blogs 
===> routes contains the routes
===> controller contains the controller fucntion which will contol the API routing in mongoDB and and expresJS
   
    1. we will be creatin a user model=> user.js in model folder
    2. we will create now some routes => user-routes.js
    3. make a controller fucntion
*** use .js while import modules in nodejs
