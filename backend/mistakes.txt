*** in .env file I was using : instead of = 
        like PORT:3000 instead of PORT=3000
*** in package.json forgot to set "type": "module"
*** script for nodemon start.
*** mongoose.connect is a promising fucntion so we use .then and .catch to catch error.
*** I was using .catch inside .then which is wrong
